# hello-world
first repo

This is a first test making changes to a file in a branch different from master.

- I like C and ASM because I feel like I understand everything going on inside the machine. However, they are difficult to master.

- I like Python for its simplicity, perfect for scripts; a decent substitute for matlab/octave when paired numpy and matplotlib. Although abstraction can lead to somewhat counter-intuitive questions (while loops are less efficient than for loops even though the latter is just the former with a counter??) but that in turn, leads to learning more (turns out for loops are already compiled in C, whilst while loops need to be interpreted for each iteration, e.g. making new objects for each counter increment because ints are immutable!)

- VBA and MATLAB because of work and study, respectively.

- Java (and Kotlin) for apps!

- JS for website building, together with HTML & CSS.

- I'd like to try Scala, Rust or Go at some point.
